## Introduction
This is a concise framework for [github blog](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) writing. There exists many framworks, i.e. [Hexo](hexo.io), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), etc.. But in my workflow, though [makrdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is simple enough, I usually use note software, like [Evernote](https://evernote.com/), [Wiz](http://www.wiz.cn), [Youdao Note](https://note.youdao.com/) which record my thoughts and good articles, alternatively, they are suitable for a editor. Therefore, I think that maybe I can make a software to generate static pages like Hexo, but the content is generated by note software. 

## Usage
### 1. Make your own github blog page. 
You can Google it easily.
### 2. Deploy.
Clone the repo and put it in a floder. Then run

	python deploy.py
### 3. Use note software to generate sharing links.
Just Google the software U used. Maybe you are requested to be a paid user.
### 4. Copy the links to **source.json** file.
The json file have 3 keys: url, file and delay.

1. url. url is a string or an array of strings. You put the sharing links here.
2. file. file is a string or an array of strings. You put the file names here.
3. delay. delay is an integer which shows the delay time.
### 5. Run noteshare.py.
	python noteshare.py
The html files store in ./public/articles/.

*-Note-*:

The noteshare also supports arguments for single html generation. If the arguments aren't empty, the arguments first.

* --mode default is 1 item generation. If --mode is not 0, it means many items generation.
* --file 
* --url
* --delay

You can put your favicon in public folder. 
	python noteshare.py --mode=2 --delay=3
### 6. Configure config.json.
The json file have 3 keys: items_of_every_page, css and title.

1. items_of_every_page. The number of items shown in each main page.
2. css. The markdown css render file. [link](https://markdowncss.github.io/)  
3. title. The blog title.

### 7. Copy the article links to **index** file.
index file is the file written titles, descriptions and links. The format is:

	title1
	desp1
	/articles/my_blog1
	---
	title2
	desp2
	/articles/my_blog2

"---" is the separator or comment symbol.

### 8. Run gindex.py
	python gindex.py

Then open browser, input localhost:8888.
